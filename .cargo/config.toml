# Required to have the proper environment variables set to
# build the starkware-libs/sequencer dependencies with Native mode.

# The `CAIRO_NATIVE_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` env variable must point to an _ABSOLUTE_ path where
# the `libcairo_native_runtime.a` file will be stored and found.
#
# Since the runtime is built by the blockifier crate's build script, it will be stored
# in blockifier's build directory, unless an absolute path is provided through this env variable.
# This variable must be set before running `cargo build` or `cargo test`,
# to overwrite what might be defined in a `config.toml` file.

# Use `lld` for linking instead of `ld`, since we run out of memory while linking with `ld` on
# 16-cores linux machines, see:
# https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/build-configuration.html#linking.
# TODO: remove this once `rust` stabilizes `lld` as the default linker, currently only on nightly:
# https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/39915#issuecomment-618726211
